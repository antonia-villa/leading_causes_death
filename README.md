# PROJECT 1

# Technical Requirements

Load JSON Data from API
Create Visual using D3 Library
Make Visual interactive using d3
Create Back Button or RESET to refresh data pages
Use Javascript or JQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy visual, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

# Technologies Used
jquery
randomColor Generator
bootstrap
d3
ToastR


# Approach Taken
Started by finding open source data API
Practiced Parsing Open Source Data into large data sets
Created first visual from all data

Analyized data to rethink how to visualize output

Created sub-data sets to be used to zoom in on different aspects of the data
Created two visuals to start viewing the data at a high level and zoom in based on users choice

In order to meet game requirements, created game functionality to guess data distribution

Created final data visual to look at the data at the most granular level

Added back button to allow the user move through the data visual

# Issues
Learning to parse JSON data into smaller data sets
Learning to use D3 library
Adding event listeners to SVG objects
Transitioning code to use jQUERY consistently and remove vanilla javascript
Modals logging data and saving user interactions 

# Fun Stuff
Thinking about data respresentation
Styling the data visuals


# Unsolved Problems
Tooltip functionality is not working as planned
Issues getting data to append to tooltips

# Next Steps
Fixing tooltips
Adding more data to tooltips in order for user to understand exact data points and distribution
Creating more dynamic functions in order to accept data from any API
